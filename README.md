##Datenite

This app is for people who are on a date, or at an event, and need to find an establishment.  They donâ€™t want to have to mess around with search, filters for ratings, or location. They just want to find the best bar or resturant within walking distance.

We used the following technologies:

* [Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org) 
* [Browserify NPM package](http://browserify.org/)
* [Bootswatch a flavor of Bootstrap](http://bootswatch.com/)
* [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation)
* [Google Geocoder] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/)
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) 
* [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/)
